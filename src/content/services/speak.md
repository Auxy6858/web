### Voice chat with people on your Wii!

The Wii Speak Channel can be used again, thanks to combined efforts with RiiConnect24 and <a
        href="https://wiimmfi.de/">Wiimmfi</a>. If you have a Wii Speak, you can register Wii Friends with RiiConnect24
      and chat over Wiimmfi. You can also send voice messages to other users via Wii Mail, even if they don't have a Wii
      Speak.

Clicking the blue button above will take you to the download page of RiiConnect24-Patcher. The Windows version of
      the tool has an option to download and patch the Wii Speak Channel.
