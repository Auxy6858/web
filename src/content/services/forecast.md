## Check the weather from anywhere right from your Wii!

<br>

With the Forecast Channel, and you can view the weather forecast for hundreds
      of cities all across the globe! You can also view your local forecast on the Wii Menu. We use <a
        href="https://accuweather.com/">AccuWeather</a> as our new weather source, unlike the original version of the channel, which used <a
        href="https://global.weathernews.com">Weathernews</a>.

Some games also use the Forecast Channel for special features! To see
          the status of which ones are working with WiiLink, <a href="/services/forecast-stats">click here.</a>
