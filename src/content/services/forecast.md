### Check the local and international forecasts on your Wii.

The Forecast Channel works with WiiLink, and you can view the forecasts for several hundreds
      of cities. You can also view your local forecast on the Wii Menu. We use <a
        href="https://accuweather.com/">AccuWeather</a> as the weather source, unlike <a
        href="https://global.weathernews.com">Weathernews</a> that Nintendo used.

Some games have compatibility with the Forecast Channel. To see
          the status of which ones are working with WiiLink, <a href="/services/forecast-stats">click here.</a>
