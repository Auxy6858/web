Hello gamers, it is Alex here with some VERY important news, so read carefully.

#### Donate!

As you may know, Nintendo have released a remastered version of Pikmin 1 + 2 for the GameCube, for the Switch! It's great, and honestly, amazing too.

One of our developers (oscie) really want's this game, so, donate (or not, I'm just a virtual sign)!
